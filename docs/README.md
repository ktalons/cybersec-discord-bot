# Demo assets

This folder holds media referenced by the README.

## Files
- demo.gif — Placeholder GIF used in the README’s Demo section.
- screenshot.png — Optional static screenshot if you prefer PNG/JPEG instead of a GIF.

## Recommendations
- Keep GIFs under ~2–3 MB for fast loading on GitHub.
- Suggested dimensions: 1200×675 or 1280×720 (16:9) for readability, or crop to focus on the relevant UI.
- For recordings, tools like Kap (macOS), OBS, or ScreenToGif (Windows) work well. You can also convert short MP4 clips to GIFs with tools like ffmpeg or gifski.

## Updating the README
- Replace demo.gif with your real demonstration (keep the same filename to avoid changing the README).
- If you add screenshot.png, update the image link in README if you want to reference it explicitly.
